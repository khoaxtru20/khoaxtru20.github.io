### The Project
I created a tower defense game for a class on game development.

### Process
I feel like most of my contributions were giving my teammates a hard time by fixing things that weren't broken (Unity Collaboration didn't help me out either), but I did structure (and restructure) the code in a way that I thought helped the readability of it. I made a lot of the decisions for the UI and the visuals. Specifically, I fleshed out the functionality of the menus for buying and selling towers, and I designed the look of the towers. Additionally I contributed to the functionality of the cells that make up the grid on which the towers are placed.

### Results
Screenshots to come, and if I have time I will post a video of it in action.

*Thanks to Keith Kravis and Olivia Cole for their patience and contributions.*
