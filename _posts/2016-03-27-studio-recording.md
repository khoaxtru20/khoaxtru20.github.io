### The Project
I arranged and recorded this song based off of [Gael Kim's song](https://soundcloud.com/gael-kim/please-dont){: target="\_blank"} of the same name. I hope she sends her vocals to me so I can finally complete it....

### Results

Thanks to Chris Pow, Lena Goren (guitars), Jeff Maginity (drums), and Matt Griffin (bass) for being so talented and helping me out on this.
