### The Project
In the fall, I worked with Northwestern's Knight Lab to design a data visualization project using projection mapping technology and techniques. The team came up with a prototype that portrayed energy usage in Illinois.

### Process
To make this, we dabbled in software like Cinema 4D, Adobe After Effects, and Mad Mapper. I contributed to the graphics of the first thirty seconds of the video, and we have the Segal Design masters students to thank for the laser-cut 3D model of the Chicago skyline.

#### In the beginning

#### Hello World

#### Let's Visualize Data...in 3D!

##### What

##### How

##### Why

### Takeaways

### Results
One thing we didn't have time to get to was integrating words or audio to describe the visuals. See below the text we would have included.

<br>[1:00-1:06] "Every single street lamp, television set and coffee shop in the city is powered by one of these 4 sources"
<br>[1:06-1:12] "The profile of the entire US looks somewhat different. Less nuclear, a lot more renewable."
<br>[1:12-1:16] THE WORDS 'NUCLEAR', 'FOSSIL FUELS', 'RENEWABLES', AND 'OTHER' LISTED UNDER PROPORTIONATE PROJECTIONS
<br>[1:16-1:22] "But more fossil fuels as well."
<br>[1:26-1:32] "In 2017, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel Announced a new energy initiative."
<br>[1:32-1:38] "City buildings are to be powered by 100% Renewable Energy by 2025."
<br>[1:38-1:44] "Even the Chicago Public Schools, Chicago Housing Authority and Chicago Park District are joining in–"
<br>[1:44-End] "And hopefully setting the course for Chicago’s clean energy future."
