A visual work mixed live with Modul8. Music by Camille Michelotti. Camille and I performed this piece in front of a small audience as a part of a showcase of other live works. During the performance, the visuals did not go as smoothly as I had hoped (yikes!), but it was a fun process coming up with the idea for this piece and rehearsing and performing it with Camille. Some of the moving graphics were altered with Adobe After Effects.

elastic.tv and Off the Air. Your move (to hire me).
