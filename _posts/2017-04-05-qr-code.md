Ever wondered what it's like being a Northwestern tour guide? Well, it doesn't matter. Today you will take on the role of a lifetime and give a unique tour of the sites around the Arts Circle! Don't worry. There aren't actual people waiting for you outside. Instead, we're going to stream this live on Facebook (weather permitting) for all the prospies and their families to see! After this onboarding process, we will be taking our positions at our respective locations and scanning the QR codes that are there to receive our final instructions.

Our supervisor listed the following requirements for our video:
* It has to be continuous and *no longer* than 10 minutes.
* One person will be the Timekeeper and make sure we do not go over time.
* Except for the Timekeeper, we each have to take turns filming.
* We have to talk about all 9 sites listed below.

We can start at any location, but for logistical purposes, the order in which we shoot the sites will be in either a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction (see the map for clarification). When the Timekeeper decides to move on, the guide will become the camera operator for the next location. The first camera operator will be the guide at the last location in the order.

Talk amongst yourselves to decide who will do what:

* Timekeeper
* The Chicago Skyline (in the distance)
* South Campus Parking Garage
* Louis Hall
* Marshall Dance Center
* Wirtz Center (back/theatre entrance)
* Block Museum
* Pick-Staiger Concert Hall
* Regenstein Hall
* Ryan Center for the Musical Arts (SS Bienen)

You have complete freedom as a tour guide and a camera operator. Be yourself and have fun with it. Remember to scan your QR code for additional instructions. **We will begin timing when we start filming at the first location.**
