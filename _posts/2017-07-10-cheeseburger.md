What if food delivery was turned into a game?

You'd get Cheeseburger!

It's like the game Diner Dash on wheels.

As with all my other Northwestern projects, I had 10 weeks to complete this game. Working with Alex Stone and Andy Mcconnell, we created Cheeseburger! on Unity, building it up from scratch. I mostly worked in the animations and the pixel art.

In the game, you are a food deliverer on bike. You must pick up and deliver as much food as possible within the time limit. The more you deliver, the more money you make! It's an arcade style game in which you try to get the highest score.

It's simply made, but it's a functioning, playable game and considering this is the first one I have ever helped build, I'm proud of the result.

If we had more time and could develop it further, we had ideas of creating more maps and levels, creating a shop to exchange money for vehicle upgrades, and adding more obstacles like weather related road conditions or AIs trying to steal your deliveries.

When we tested our game, it was well received. People had fun playing it, although they mentioned the biker controls and physics took some getting used to. This iteration would have also benefitted from better visual hints about where food can be found and their drop off locations.

If you have any questions about this project, reach out to me! I'd be happy to answer any questions.

Below, you can find a little preview Alex made showcasing our game.
