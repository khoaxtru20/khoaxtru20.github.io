A short narration using AFrame. On a Samsung Galaxy S5, I took two visually interesting 360 degree photos and evoked the myth of Icarus for this humorous interactive piece. Use your mouse or finger to look around. If you are on a mobile device, you can tap the icon in the lower right corner to view the piece through a 360 video headset like Google Cardboard.
