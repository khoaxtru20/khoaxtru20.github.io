### The Project
I created an amusing 360&deg; experience on Aframe for a class on alternative reality.

### The Process
On a Samsung Galaxy S5, I took two visually interesting 360&deg; photos and evoked the myth of Icarus for this humorous interactive piece. Use your mouse or finger to look around. If you are on a mobile device, you can tap the icon in the lower right corner to view the piece through a 360&deg; video headset like Google Cardboard.
