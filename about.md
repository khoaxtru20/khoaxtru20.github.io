### About the Author

My name is Khoa Truong. I am a rising senior at Northwestern University studying film and computer science. I create experimental digital graphics and films and explore the potential of using technology to tell beautiful, interactive, and compelling stories. Some issues of interest: environmental conservation, education, autism research, mental health, non-profits, tech startups.

Some other things about me:

* I am from the southeast side of Houston, Texas.
* I am a self-proclaimed jazz pianist. If you ask me to play, I will most likely embarrass myself, but I like the improvisation and collaboration.
* One of my biggest side projects is creating a documentary of my family history and journey to America.
* I watch a lot of horror movies. Mostly since my girlfriend watches a lot of horror movies. [She has a pretty dope Instagram IMO.](https://www.instagram.com/byzantineilse)
