This site was created to display my work. I'll explain more about its origins later.

### About the Author

My name is Khoa Truong. I am a junior at Northwestern University studying film and computer science. I create experimental digital graphics and films and explore the potential of using technology to tell beautiful, interactive, and compelling stories. Some issues of interest: environmental conservation, education, autism research, mental health, non-profits, tech startups.

I am originally from Houston, TX. I am a self-proclaimed jazz pianist (i.e. don't ever ask me to play for I WILL embarrass myself). I love my parents, my brother, and my beautiful girlfriend, Ilse Vielma. Her Instagram is bomb.
